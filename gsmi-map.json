It forms a legal basis for the trading of rights using electronic securities registers and adds a new license category for the maintainance of a new crypto securities register.  The initial draft of this law was published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, to allow the issuance bonds in digital form (i.e. without physical certificate as currently  generally required under German civil law), either through a central digital register (administered by a licensed central securities depository) or through decentralized blockchain-based \"crypto register\" (administered by the issuer or a service provider designated by the issuer). The draft law further provides for a civil law framework for the transfer of certain blockchain-based digital bonds, and subjects the administrators of crypto registers to a license requirement under the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz). It is generally intended to in the future extend the scope of the draft law to equity securities and investment fund units. The law was passed on December 16, 2020.",

It covers any commercial use of DLT for storing or transmitting value. These firms must be authorized by the GFSC as a DLT Provider. The framework applies to uses of DLT for business activities engaged in “the transmission or storage of value belonging to others” and which are not subject to other existing legal regulations. Some businesses fall outside the scope of the new regulatory frameworks, including decentralized virtual currencies, DLT software developers, users purchasing goods and services with VC, and investment in VC for private purposes. The new DLT legal framework is based on a nine-point foundation: honesty and integrity, fairness and clarity, adequate financial and non-financial resources, risk management, protection of client assets (custodial), secure systems and protocols, prevention of financial crime (AML and CFT) and disaster recovery/crisis management.",

Specifically, the Act defines “virtual currency” as any currency which (whilst not itself being issued by, or legal tender in, any jurisdiction) – (a) digitally represents value; (b) is a unit of account; (c) functions as a medium of exchange; and (d) is capable of being digitally exchanged for money in any form. Anyone operating as a digital currency exchanger is exempt from registration requirements if their annual turnover is less than £150,000. The Jersey legislature also approved a change to the dependency's money laundering statutes, which would apply to digital currency exchangers.",

The QFC is a special jurisdiction within the country with its own legal, business, tax, and regulatory infrastructure. \r\nThe ban defines virtual asset services to include “the exchange or transfer of virtual assets, or the exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies.” Specifically, the regulator stated that the ban also includes “anything of value that acts as a substitute for currency, that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes.” Consequently, an exchange service facilitating cryptocurrency transactions is illegal in the QFC.\r\nExemptions to the ban include security tokens and other financial instruments regulated by the QFCRA, the Qatar Central Bank, or the Qatar Financial Markets Authority. These are exempt because these tokens are subject to full AML and KYC verification. In contrast, cryptocurrencies not regulated by a governmental agency within Qatar are banned because they are not subject to AML and KYL verifications.\r\nThe QFC ban is designed to prevent the use of cryptocurrency for financing terrorism and money laundering. The governor of Qatar’s Central Bank stated this task could only be achieved through a stricter and more effective regulatory and legislative framework.",
